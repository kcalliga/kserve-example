Honeybees are vital pollinators that help many crops and wild plants reproduce. A typical worker bee lives for about six weeks during peak season and spends much of its life foraging. Bees communicate the location of flowers through the famous waggle dance, which encodes both direction and distance. Colonies depend on a single queen whose primary role is laying eggs. Pesticides, habitat loss, parasites like Varroa mites, and climate stress can all threaten bee populations.
